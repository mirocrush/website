The current project is for creating blogs.
But my original purpose was to create each user's portfolio websites dynamically.
Each user can create several websites.
Whenever a user creates a website, they get their own website subdomain and it will be stored in db.
Of course the content and style of portfolio website will be complicated but for now, I simply use name, title, summary and link (subdomain - this is similar with linkedin profile link). in terms subdomain, we will use 32bit random string including number and english characters(we don't verify case sensitive). Each users can CRUD their portfolios. So we need custom page for CRUD user's portfolios. Each porfolios link will be like talentcodehub.com/xncwad81eu12d8j128j128d182dh. talentcodehub.com/ + 32bit random string. when we visit these websites, the project shouldn't display the original websites style (header or contents). This is considered as the total different website. I think this is multi-tennat concept. In the future, I am gonna introduce "theme" concept to each portfolio websites. But for now, we will use only one theme. When we direct to that each one's portfolio websites, they should redirect to new window and display the portfolio websites created before by specific users. For this you need to design tables for the above workflow and use it wisely.

What Makes a Social Platform Survive

Daily reason to return
Public visibility
Clear benefit for posting

If posting gives no benefit → people stop.

On Instagram → attention
On LinkedIn → career growth
On Twitter → influence
On yours → what?

Identity
- Profile with real proof (GitHub, projects)
- Availability (building / hiring / investing)

Content
- Short posts (build updates)
- Demo posts
- Problem posts

Interaction
- Comment
- Invite to collaborate (not just DM)
- Follow

Discovery
- Trending builds
- Active builders
- Open projects

Validation
- “Shipped” badge
- “Top collaborator”
- Reliability score




Nobody wakes up thinking:
“I want to join another social network.”

They think:
“I need funding.”
“I need a cofounder.”
“I need talent.”
“I need attention.”
“I need money.”
“I need to learn fast.”
“I want access to powerful people.”

Your platform must be positioned as:
“The place where opportunity moves.”


Reddit idea
Recipe: Organize conversations into niche communities where shared interest beats personal identity.

new additional requirements

very good!
Now update these:
1. currently the ui for messenger is not good, the whole website is white theme and messenger's theme is dark theme so it's not matching at all. And in the right side bar, you have to show the member list like Discord. that right side bard should be available to be toggled.

2. The route problem: Currently the messenger's server and channels' route are all same: talentcodehub.com/messenger so when I refresh the page, the current focused server and channels are refreshed. In terms of servers, every servers are consist of channels so when we visit a server, you need to be redirected to a index channel of a server. In terms of channels, the channels have their own channelKey (this is generated when a channel created). So when we visit a channel, the route will be like talentcodehub.com/messenger/channels/:channelKey.

3. In terms of join / invite a server feature is not built yet here. For join, when I visit messenger, the public servers should be listed in dashboard with pagination style and user can search, filter, sort and when click the invite link on server join card, they can visit the server invite page with new window open. In this case the invite linke will be like : talentcodehub.com/messnger/servers/invite/:inviteKey. inviteKey is unique key for each server to invite users to this platform.

4. In terms of server setting, when user click right button on server icon, they open a menu bar and users can see the features related to server like server settings and leave server and invite to server etc. In terms of settings, you open a server setting page and you can change the server name and server icon and so on. In the server setting, the owner also can kick, ban, mute other users.

5. In terms profile and dm, I have idea: We need to build reusable component for user profile (this is usually appears like user profile picture and display name and username like discord). when other users click that component, it popup a dialog showing user's public proflie. When you click that proflie component, you can see your public proflie and move to proflie edit page. In terms of dm and sending friend request, when other users click a user's proflie component they can see the send dm and send friend request button well designed.


new changes:

Okay, better than before. Fix this problems:
1. You currently displaying Discover Servers in every urls for talentcodehub.com/messenger.
So when I try to visit the server channels like: https://www.talentcodehub.com/messenger/channels/5c792f9e-7244-47c1-88a6-909f4efae586 I still have Discover Servers page on my main page. This is not what I want. The server discovering page should be display only for router : https://www.talentcodehub.com/messenger.
For other channels and servers, I need to see the chat and send chat. So get back the previous feature for sending msg and see msg for channels. When I click server, please redirect to the first channel of server, you currently do nothing when I visit that server.

2. Currently the right side bar for displaying the members list doesn't show in UI. what's wrong? check this and make it work.

3. To make website beautiful, you can use materialUI icons and other icon libraries you think it's great.


new changes:
for dms, the route should be like this: https://www.talentcodehub.com/messenger/channels/@me/:dmKey
Please implement this feature.
For chatting board, the background color should be similar with left and right sidebar and the borders shouldn't be highlighted too much.
When I others end msg on server or on dm, I cannot get the update. I think real time feature not working properly. Analyze this why happens.
I can see https://www.talentcodehub.com/api/pusher/auth has 400 error.
maybe pusher not working perfectly. Analyze this and solve the issue


new changes:
Real time messaging feature working better than before but for msg sender, if the sender sends msg, two same message is displayed on UI. only for sender. I think we need to verify msg's sender and don't display self sent msg again.
